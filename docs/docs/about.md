## About OCI

The Open Container Initiative was established in June 2015 by [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) and other leaders in the containers industry to provide an intuitive API to interact with [linux containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(virtualization)).

### Challenges for OCI

Why did the OCI get established in the first place? There were several questions and challenges that warranted community discussion and support. Generally, the focus of initial work was to better define standards for container formats and runtime. If containers were to be successful, meaning they would have widespread adoption across different systems, and have development of tools for interaction, a standard was needed that everyone could rally behind.

### Continued Challenges

Container technologies evolve on a regular basis, as do the needs of society and research groups. As new problems and use cases are brought to light, it's important that the standards for containers are continually challenged to address them. 
For this reason, it's up to you [to contribute]({{ site.baseurl }}contribute) your issues, thoughts, and questions about the OCI specifications catered to your use case. 
If there is an issue, it's the responsibility of the community to discuss and address it.
